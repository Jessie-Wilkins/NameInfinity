Alright, there is a little bit of content in this one, but all you need to know is that pseudo-randomness has to do with something that is random like. In a way, everything is pseudo-random because there are biases working to make the random events less random. But you can make something "perfectly" random if you take two independent random-like sources and use them to generate randomness. Also, randomness has to do with how predictable something is: the less predictable, the more random.

Talks about applications of pseudorandomness and then talks about some psuedorandom objects. Pseudorandom generators use a "perfectly" random seed to generate random-looking data. Randomness extractors take biased not-so-random data and stream it into uniform, random-looking data. There are two other pseudorandom methods, but they don't seem relevant to us.

Added this so we can say what kind of pseudorandom object java.util.random is. Since it is using a 48-bit seed, it is definitely a pseudorandom generator.

This is a website focused on the origins of names and happens to have a name generator. The names are pre-made. I don't think it has a truly new name generator.
